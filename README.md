# SmartGreenHouse
A mini-project for SSP class, containing a setup of a fan a dht11 sensor on seperat arduinos on the I^2C protokol.\\ 
For this to setup to work there is a need for a couple of extra libarys. The I2C anything by Nick Gammon:https://github.com/nickgammon/I2C_Anything and the libary of dht.h can be found on this site http://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-set-up-the-dht11-humidity-sensor-on-an-arduino/ 
Thanks a lot to Nick for the ease of sending anything on the I2C protocol, Circuit Basic for providing a nice setup of the dht11 and Nicholas Zambetti for the guide on wire.h.
In workings is GUI made in QT.
