# SmartGreenHouse
A mini-project for school, containing a setup of a fan a dht11 sensor on seperat arduinos on the I^2C protokol 
For this to work there is a need for a couple of extra libarys I2C anything:https://github.com/nickgammon/I2C_Anything by Nick Gammon and the libary of dht.h
Thanks a lot to Nick for the ease of sending anything on the I2C protocol
