# SmartGreenHouse
A mini-project for school, containing a setup of a fan a dht11 sensor on seperat arduinos on the I^2C protokol 
For this to work there is a need for a couple of extra libarys I2C anything:https://github.com/nickgammon/I2C_Anything by Nick Gammon and the libary of dht.h can be found here http://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-set-up-the-dht11-humidity-sensor-on-an-arduino/ 
Thanks a lot to Nick for the ease of sending anything on the I2C protocol and Circuit Basic for providing a nice setup of the dht11
